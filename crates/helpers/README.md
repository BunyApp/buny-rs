Utilities to make coding buny sources less miserable. It is available by enabling the `helpers` feature in the main crate
```toml
buny = { git = "https://github.com/Aidoku/buny-rs", features = ["helpers"] }
```
After enabling the `helpers` feature, this crate is re-exported under the `buny::helpers` namespace.
